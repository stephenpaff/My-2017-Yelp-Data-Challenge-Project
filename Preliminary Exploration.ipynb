In Section 2, I will discuss in more detail why I intend to use polarity and how it connects with similar variables. In this section, I will simply conduct sentiment analysis on the data and clean it up for further analysis.  \n",

As a categorical variable based on stated opinions, its rating system creates ambiguity. I would prefer a scale with positive and negative values to reflect a favorable and unfavorable consumer opinion respectively. Currently the 1 to 5 scale does not allow that. Bad reviews are simply less positive than good reviews. That could be easily changed by altering the scale by subtracting by 3: 1 star goes to -2, 2 stars to -1, 3 stars to 0, 4 stars to 1, and 5 stars to 2. \n",
    "\n",

    "Presumably, a 4 or 5 star rating is intended to reflect a positive experience from the user and 1 or 2 stars a negative experience as implied in the modified scale. Would every user have this system in mind when they relate, though? Does a rating of 3 always reflect a truly neutral view for all users? I would suspect the answer to be no: different users would have different internal scales and meanings for each number of stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the star rating to measure favorability would create too much ambiguity in the analysis based on these issues. At the same time, its discrete, categorical nature, despite being numerical, provide less flexibility in analysis than the continuous polarity. \n",

Even if star rating is not the best metric for favorability, it certainly reflects favorability pretty accurately.

Many people could think of vastly different scalings, however, with different intended meanings for a 3 star review. \n",

I would expect a 2-star rating and a 4-star rating to be slightly more moderate around -0.5 and 0.5 respectively.
